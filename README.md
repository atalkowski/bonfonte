# bonfonte
This is a java project grown over many years ago by writing and testing code in Java.
As such is isn't particularly tidy or useful except as a source of some interesting classes like PermuteString. 
It spans versions of java written using v8 thru to v20 but due to non backward compatibility uses v11 with v20 code commented out.

# Makefile
The Makefile was a recent addition to aid with experiments involving the protobuf tech and set up for gRPC tests.
The build of the auto-generated classes could be in the pom.xml but for now it is a manual step via the Makefile.
